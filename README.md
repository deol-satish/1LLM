# L4S-LLM :
---------------
This repository contains the source code for the L4S-LLM frameowrk modified to support Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) architecture in FreeBSD Network Stack. 

The increasing network traffic complexity and rising demands on ultra-low latency communications require smarter packet management schemes. 
Given the limitations of conventional Active Queue Management (AQM) and Deep Learning-based algorithms, 
we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges related to generalization and the complexities of model engineering.

2. Results Viz - contains code to visualise results from L4S-LLM training and evaluation
3. Misc - COntains files, folders and information used while development (Not Important)

# Testbed Setup for L4SLLM Training

We use a FreeBSD-based testbed, configured with VirtualBox, to collect the experiences required for training L4SLLM. The virtual machines (VMs) run FreeBSD 14.1, with a network setup consisting of four VMs: two clients (Client 1 and Client 2), a router, and a server.

- **Client 1** uses Cubic and NewReno congestion control algorithms simultaneously.
- **Client 2** uses the ECT(1)-enabled DCTCP algorithm.
- The **router** is configured with the custom DualPI2 algorithm for L4S support.

All clients send data to the server via the router, as shown in Figure 6. Full setup scripts and details are available in the L4S-LLM repository.
